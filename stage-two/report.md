## **Glioblastoma**
Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive primary brain tumour in adults, characterised by necrosis and endothelial proliferation.<sup>1</sup> It may arise from specific point mutations of the genes encoding IDH (isocitrate dehydrogenase).<sup>2</sup> Typical molecular changes in glioblastoma include mutations in genes regulating receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK)/ RAS/phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), p53, and retinoblastoma protein signalling.<sup>3</sup>

In this task, a gene expression dataset for glioblastoma was visualized and interpreted to generate a heatmap and downstream functional enrichment analysis was performed. This helped to understand and interpret patterns of gene expression and the biological significance of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). The task involved data preprocessing, visualization, and interpretation of functional enrichment results.

Colour selection is important for visualising and interpreting datasets using plots such as heatmaps as it enhances contrast using colour palettes to differentiate between different values in the plot and to emphasize on significant differences in the data.<sup>4</sup> Sequential colour palette does not consist of a neutral central value, while a diverging colour palette consists of two different colours with a neutral central value, which is useful for observing deviations from the midpoint. The plots can also be easier to interpret by people with colour blindness when specific colour palettes are used.<sup>5</sup> 

**Task 2** - With the same heatmap, generate a variant of your heatmap where you

1. Cluster your genes (rows) alone
1. Cluster your samples (columns) alone
1. Cluster both genes and sample together.

<a name="_hlk176856820"></a>Clustering rows (genes) and columns (samples) in the heatmap is important for data analysis as it helps to identify patterns or relationships within the dataset, providing a better visual representation of the genes and samples with similar characteristics.<sup>6</sup>

**Tasks 3 & 4** - Subset genes that are significantly upregulated and significantly downregulated. 

Visualise the fold change and negative log10 of p-values.

\- The p-value cut-off was set as 0.05, with log2fold-change of 21 to 3 for significantly upregulated genes and -22 to -3 for significantly downregulated genes.

**Task 5** - Perform functional enrichment analysis with either [ShinyGO](http://bioinformatics.sdstate.edu/go/), [GOrilla](https://cbl-gorilla.cs.technion.ac.il/) or [PANTHER](https://geneontology.org/).

- <a name="_hlk176856865"></a>The gene IDs were submitted to ShinyGO
- The p-value cutoff was set at 0.05.

**Task 6** - Using the top 5 pathways, create a straightforward visualization (such as a lollipop plot, dot plot, line plot or bubble plot) that displays the number of genes associated with each pathway. The plot should also reflect the significance of each pathway by scaling the points according to the negative **log10** of the **p-value**.

1) **Loop of Henle development** – It is the process involved in the development of a part of the kidney called as Loop of Henle, which consists of a descending limb and an ascending limb. This structure is involved in regulating the concentration of urine.<sup>7</sup> This developmental pathway is regulated by various signalling molecules, growth and transcription factors, including Wnt and Notch.<sup>8</sup> Upregulation of these signalling mechanisms in glioblastoma is associated with resistance to apoptosis and increased cell survival, which can promote tumour growth.

1) **Proximal/distal pattern formation** – It is the process which determines the formation of proximal-distal regions of developing tissues, which is mainly stimulated by FGF (Fibroblast Growth Factor) signalling.<sup>9</sup> While FGF usually promotes the formation of distal structures, other elements such as retinoic acid promotes proximal features.<sup>10</sup> Excess FGF signalling can facilitate tumour progression in glioblastoma.

1) **Lymphocyte chemotaxis** – It is the process by which cells cross barriers such as the vascular endothelium and migrates within tissues, which is typically stimulated by chemokines via G-protein coupled receptors.<sup>11</sup> Production of chemokines by glioblastoma cells can progress tumour formation by suppressing the body's immune response.<sup>12</sup>
